# **CERiNG's Mod Releases Repository**
This repository serves as a collection of modded simfiles by CERiNG. This includes Sight Reading Tournaments, packs, and standalone files.

*NOTE: This repository does not include standalone files created for rushes, jams, or other community-directed collaboration packs.*

## **Installation**
All modfiles in this repository are optimized to work best with the latest version of [**NotITG**](https://www.noti.tg/), which is also required for these files to run.

### **For packs**
Download the selected pack, and unzip the contents directly into the `Songs` folder. You're all set!

### **For standalone files**
Download the selected file, and unzip the contents wherever you'd like. Then, drag-and-drop the folder into the NotITG window! You can also unzip the contents within a subdirectory in the `Songs` folder (ex. `Songs\MyPackName`).
